# Database-Management-Systems-Hospital-Management-System
This repository is for a project in Database Management Systems. We are creating a Hospital Management System using MySQL and XAMPP Apache for the backend and a FrontEnd is created using PHP, HTML, and CSS.
Future edits to this README will be necessary.

# Install requirements
To set up the webserver you will need to first download XAMPP. Once XAMPP is installed you will navigate to the folder on your drive called "xampp". Inside of xampp there will be a folder called "htdocs" and inside of that folder is where the webpages source code is stored. For this project i put the code in a folder called "code".

# Executing and accessing code
To access the code once it has been added to xampp/htdocs/code you will then start the Apache server and MySQL server in the XAMPP application.
Once the servers are started you will open a web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
From here you will need to create the Orders database with the provided "CreateDB.sql" script. After the database has been created you need to seed it with data from the "LoadDB.sql" script. These scripts are ran in the SQL tab on the phpmyadmin webpage.

Once this is complete the database and website are setup and ready to interact with. This can be done by going to http://localhost/code/.
